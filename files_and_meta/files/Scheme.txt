   transliteration to ...                                |
    /         \                          translation to Old Slavonic    
  cyryllic    glagolic                     /                     \ 
                                        with cyr. letters      glagolic letters

Possible scheme:
"(1)" — when both translation and transliteration are required
"(2)" — only translation is required
"(3)" — only transliteration is required
(1) -> 1. Try to make a translation with transliteration,
          using dictionary. If fails, go 2, then 4.
(2) -> 2. Try to make a translation without a transliteration.
          If fails, go 3.
       3. Return a phrase as it *was*.
(3) -> 4. Try to make a transliteration, using dictionary.
          If fails, just do transliteration by the rule.
          + In glagolic: seems to be, transliteration by the rule
            can be done correctly always.
