Possible scheme
---------------

 * "(1)" — When both translation and transliteration are required
 * "(2)" — Only translation is required
 * "(3)" — Only transliteration is required
 * (1) -> 1. Try to make a translation with transliteration,
             using dictionary. If fails, go 2, then 4.
 * (2) -> 2. Try to make a translation without a transliteration.
             If fails, go 3.
          3. Return a phrase as it *was*.
 * (3) -> 4. Try to make a transliteration, using dictionary.
             If fails, just do transliteration by the rule.
             + In glagolitic: seems to be, transliteration by the rule
               can be done correctly always.
