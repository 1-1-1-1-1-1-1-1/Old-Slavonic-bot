Here is a main idea of tracker at root.

Check each XXX ms, whether the content of `fname` changed, for each `fname`
in `files`.  If changed -- warn and add the corresponding note to the dict.
`warns_info` (that "file `fname` changed and the last warn was done at
<...>").  If changed at least ones, clicking the button of corresponding fname
will display message like "changed at `<some_date>`; first edited at
`<some_date>`".  Otherwise clicking will display message like "wasn't edited".

When the files are reloaded via `write_files` or like that, they are doing some
work like: stop the tracker, do stuff with "write files", reload tracker,
meaning "again enabling", but only after reseting variables as "edit time",
files edited etc.
