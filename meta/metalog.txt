 - started editing
 - raw: config, worker, !private-launcher, README, .gitignore, .env, requirements.txt
 - plans: reforming ...
 - (main: pytelegrambotapi -> telethon (a lib to create and work at clients))
 - metasymbol at `worker`: `mark:` (comment)
 - note: some things, if they are from previous, should not really work

---

adding new docs:
yet only here (maybe)

 - https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/
 - local: [(1)](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/modules/client.html#telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions)

adding to .gitignore:

 - *.session
 - *.session-journal

change requirements.txt:

 - [ ] \(Remove\) pyTelegramBotAPI
 - [x] \(Add\) telethon
 
 other:

  - remove controll.py(w), as it's deprecated
